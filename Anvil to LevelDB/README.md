## Anvil to LevelDB converter usage
- Import your Anvil world in and rename that folder to 'world'. 
- Run the start.bat file or start.sh to start the converter.
- The converter will now convert your world.
- Once conversion has finished, create a folder named world and move the db folder and the level.dat file into the world folder.

### Warnings
- The Anvil to LevelDB converter won't convert your level.dat file. The best fix for this is to generate a new flat world in Minecraft PE, and copy that world's level.dat into your converted world's root folder(where the region folder is located). It is known that the converted land and the generated land won't line up together where they meet. There is a level.dat file provided.
