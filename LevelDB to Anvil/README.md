## LevelDB to Anvil converter usage
- Import your LevelDB world in and rename that folder to 'world'. 
- Run the start.bat file or start.sh to start the converter.
- The converter will now convert your world.
- Once conversion has finished, rename the 'worldanvil' folder to 'region', create a folder named world and move the level.dat file into the world folder.

### Warnings
- The LevelDB to Anvil converter won't convert your level.dat file. The best fix for this is to generate a new flat world in Minecraft PC, and copy that world's level.dat into your converted world's root folder(where the region folder is located). It is known that the converted land and the generated land won't line up together where they meet. There is a level.dat file provided.
